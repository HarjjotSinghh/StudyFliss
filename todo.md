# SEO Changes
## High Priority
- By creating a custom 404 error page with helpful links and information, users are more likely to stay on the site and continue to explore.
- Consider using structured data in your webpage as it can help search engines gain a better understanding of your content.
- To improve the website experience for your visitors, it is recommended to eliminate any render-blocking resources on this webpage.
- Connect your webpage with social media networks using APIs or AddThis, as social signals are becoming increasingly important for search engines to validate a site's trustworthiness and authority.
## Medium Priority
- Add a sitemap file to help search engine crawlers index content more thoroughly and quickly.
- Add a robots.txt file to properly communicate with web crawlers and prevent unwanted access to sensitive content.
- Add a Google Analytics script to this website to help in diagnosing potential SEO issues by monitoring site visitors and traffic sources.
## Low Priority
- Serve properly sized images to reduce page loading times and to improve user's experience.
- To protect against spam harvesters, consider hiding or obfuscating email addresses in your page code.
- Using more than 20 HTTP requests on a webpage can negatively impact the loading time.
- Consider moving inline CSS styles to an external stylesheet to improve site performance and maintain separation of content and design.
